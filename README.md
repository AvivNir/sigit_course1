## Course exercises
The "Self.py" course includes a series of Python exercises that cover various topics,  
The exercise's answers are provided in separate directories,  
with each file containing several answers.  

In this project, you can find the Python files with the answers to the course questions.   
The files are organized by unit number, and each file includes the exercise number and its solution.  

### The topics covered in the course include:
- Variables - **unit2** 
- Strings - **unit3** 
- If, else - **unit4**
- Functions - **unit5**
- Lists - **unit6**
- Loops - **unit7**
- Advanced data structures - **unit8**

- Hangman Game 


## Hangman Game
The final project of the "Self.py" course is the implementation of the "hangman" game.  
In this game, the player has to guess a secret word by suggesting letters.  
The player has a limited number of guesses, and each incorrect guess adds a body part to the hanging man figure.  

In this project, you can find the implementation of the "hangman" game, under the directory **"hangman-unit10-TheGame"** 
in the file **"hangman.py"**.

To play the game, run the hangman.py file using Python.  
The game will prompt you to enter the path to the words.txt file and the index of   
the secret word to be used in the game.  
Once the game starts, you can enter letters to guess the secret word, do not enter invalid characters, only English alphabets.  
The game ends when you correctly guess the word or run out of guesses.
